You can make anything you want on a website. You can build it and once it is on the internet, you can give the address to your friends and family to see on their computer or phone.

Things you can build:
- A list of your favorite music
- A list of your pokemon card collection
- A baseball rule book
- The rules to a board game you made up
- A scoreboard for a Mario Kart tournament
- An art gallery
- A library of stories or poems
- A list of your favorite websites and links to them
- A list of your favorite restaurants
- A collection of knock-knock jokes
- All of the video game secrets you've learned
- A list of all the Dogman books and what happens in each story

and so much more, these are meant as ideas to get you started!

Here is an example webpage you can use as a reference

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    <title>Here you are</title>
    <link href="/style.css" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" media="all">
  </head>
  <body>
    <h1>Welcome to my Website!</h1>
    <h2>This is a smaller heading than H1</h2>
    <h3>This is the third size of heading</h3>
    <h4>This is the fourth size of heading</h4>

    <p>This is a paragraph! Here's how you make a link: <a href="https://tomhummel.com">Tom's website</a>.</p>

    <p>Here's how you can make <strong>bold</strong> and <em>italic</em> text.</p>

    <p>Here's how you can add an image:</p>
    <img src="/my-image.png">

    <!-- This is a comment, nothing is visible in your webpage which is inside a comment-->

    <ul>
      <li>First thing</li>
      <li>Second thing</li>

    </ul>
    
    <!-- This is a "Horizontal Rule", a line which divides the content above and below it. -->
