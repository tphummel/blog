## Background

I'm a patient gamer. I'm currently playing games in the Wii, Game Boy Advance, Nintendo DS, and Nintendo 3DS generations. I'm not smug about this, I just fell behind modern gaming around 2005 and have never really recovered.

As video game platforms are discontinued and are no longer available in retail stores, prices in secondary markets hit bottom. There is a price valley that trails a platform being discontinued which can last 1-3 years. After this valley/trough, prices begin to rise due to collectibility. Games tend to become more scarce the longer it has been since production concluded, further driving up prices.

As of June 2020, it seems likely we are at the bottom of the Nintendo DS market as a whole before the library becomes more collectible, more scarce, and thus more expensive in coming years (as we'll see, there are already Nintendo DS games which are highly collectible and expensive, but I'll be ignoring them because there is little value due to their already high price.)

I want to buy games now at cheaper price so I can play them when I get the time. Instead of waiting until I have the time and then buying them when their price will likely be higher.

## Market Overview

Here is an overview of the 296 Nintendo DS games rated 70 or above by [Metacritic](https://www.metacritic.com) (minimum 7 reviews) and the price to buy the game loose (no box or manual), used on secondary markets according to [Video Game Price Charts](https://www.pricecharting.com). This gives a sense of the overall shape of Nintendo DS loose cartridge market, ignoring mediocre and low quality games.

- Avg Price: $14.56
- Median Price: $10.12
- Avg Score: 77.3
- Median Score: 76.5

## Methodology

- Browse a metacritic page of results like: [All-Time Nintendo DS Reviews](https://www.metacritic.com/browse/games/score/metascore/all/ds/filtered)
- Open developer tools > Console
- Paste the javascript into the console prompt
- Execute the javascript
- the exported json is now in your clipboard. paste the json into a file and save.

### Notes

- You can get 100 results per page so it isn't too bad doing it this way.
- My purposes were to export top reviews for discontinued video game platforms. This is a one time operation so I didn't need further automation.
- metacritic by default only shows games with 7 or more reviews. i left this limit in place in general.

### Metacritic Browser Script
```
let items = Array.from(document.querySelectorAll('li.game_product div.product_wrap')).map((d) => {
  let url = d.children[0].children[0].href
  let extraData = d.children[2].innerText
  let extraDataItems = extraData.split('\n')
  let userScore = parseFloat(extraDataItems[0].replace('User: ', ''))
  let releaseDate
  let hardwareCompat = 'none'
  if (extraDataItems.length === 3) {
    releaseDate = extraDataItems[2]
    hardwareCompat = extraDataItems[1]
  } else {
    releaseDate = extraDataItems[1]
  }

  return {
    platform: (new URL(url)).pathname.split('/')[2],
    title: d.children[0].innerText,
    hardware_compatibility: hardwareCompat,
    link: url,
    metascore: parseInt(d.children[1].innerText, 10),
    user_score: userScore,
    release_date: releaseDate,
  }
})

copy(items)
```

## Metacritic Workflow

get all of the individual page files using the script above.

then combine:
```
cat *.json | jq --slurp '. | flatten' > combined.json
```

count records by platform:
```
cat combined.json | jq '.[] .platform' | awk '{ FS="\n" count[$1]++}END{for(j in count) print j","count[j]}' | sort -t "," -k2 -nr
"xbox-360",900
"playstation-3",800
"playstation-2",800
"xbox",500
"ds",400
"wii",300
"GameCube",300
"Game Boy Advance",300
"3ds",300
"playstation",200
"wii-u",186
"nintendo-64",89
```

build final csv
```
cat combined.json | jq -r '.[] | [.platform, .title, .hardware_compatibility, .link, .metascore, .user_score, .release_date] | @csv' > all.csv
```

import the file into a google sheet for further analysis

### Price Charting Script

- browse the [Nintendo DS price guide](https://www.pricecharting.com/console/nintendo-ds)
- sort all games alphabetically
- continuously scroll to the bottom of the page to be sure all records are loaded
- open developer tools > console
- paste and execute the script below
- paste the contents into a new file.

```
let items = Array.from(document.querySelectorAll('tr')).slice(1).map(i => {
  return {
    title: i.querySelector('td.title')?.innerText,
    loose_price: i.querySelector('td.used_price')?.innerText?.replace('$', '')
  }
})

copy(items)
```

### Price Charting Workflow

get all of the individual system files, one per platform using the price charting script
need to add platform column still

then combine:
```
cat *-pricing.json | jq --slurp '. | flatten' > combined-pricing.json
```

build final csv
```
cat nintendo-ds-prices.json | jq -r '.[] | [.title, .loose_price] | @csv' > nintendo-ds-prices.csv
```

### Joining Datasets

I assigned an id to each game in price charting download. i used that id to map to the metacritic records. This allowed discretion to choose between particular variants, focusing on the least expensive way to acquire a game.

### Data 

- [metacritic dataset (gen 5,6,7 + wii u)]({{ "files/metacritic-gen5-6-7.csv" | relURL }})
