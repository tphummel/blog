## Git Notes

Add metadata to a git object without altering the git object itself. 

Seems similar to `git tag` but a little bit richer. This recalls chicken and egg workflows where I want to bump the version in a `VERSION` or `package.json` metadata file as a part of a release without editing the content of the release itself to bump the version.
