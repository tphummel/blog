The iteration of choice is [Dr. Mario 64 for Nintendo 64][0]. We play local multiplayer with 2-4 players. When playing with fewer than 4, you are forced to fill the vacancies with bots. The game imposes a format which crowns the winner as the first player to reach three wins. We ignore this for the most part.

We play on medium speed with virus levels at 10 (the middle of each slider). Bots (if necessary) with 3-star ratings are used with speed/virus settings the same as human players.

The winner is the first player to eliminate all of his viruses, as determined by the game. After the winner players who stayed alive the entire round are ranked by fewest viruses remaining. Players who were killed before the natural end of the match are then ranked by fewest viruses remaining.
