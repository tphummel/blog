        Dominic aka Avocado kid. Officer hydration. Officer hydration is Gerald
        fords son. Firearms are terrifying. Mann loves uncompromising
        professionalism. Method acting is cool. Method acting is dead. Insomnia is
        heat 2. The women of heat are so well developed. The women of heat get so
        little screen time. Hank Azaria is awesome. Schwartz is a throw away
        character who gets way too much attention. Ashley Judd is larger than life.
        Were it not for Weinstein .... There is some undetermined number of seconds
        that are different between the definitive and theatrical releases. Australia
        has no gun violence. Americans should all move there. Deniro had one good
        movie after heat: ronin. Pacino had two good movies after heat: insider and
        insomnia. “My brother Richard gon’ talk to ya” - Blake’s impression is super
        good. Mykelti Williamson. Blake says it like "Michael T. Williamson". Red
        desert movie. Sea of love movie. Dog day afternoon. insomnia is either a
        sequel to heat or to patch adams. Asphalt jungle

        117 done. 1990’s Mann/spinotti was meticulously planned and executed. 2000s
        Mann was more improvised. Less good results as such

        121. This is a very long movie. But it is so economical. No wasted second. .
        121. Somehow after the centerpiece heist. We feel empathy with Chris in the
        surgery chair. The pain he’s in with Jeremy piven. . Throughout the heist
        and afterward. Is Neil making calculations about the liability of Chris.
        Capture, injury. So much would be simpler if Chris died.. Spin-off. Old
        broken Chris becomes  Neil and starts his own crew. 121 done

        Fichtner’s van zant: he vastly overestimated his capabilities. As a dirty
        business man he should have been content to make his 40% after being made
        whole by insurance. Instead he wanted to make a statement. He got caught. In
        the end nothing outwardly changed about van zant despite a huge internal
        arc. Nobody gives a care when he is killed. The only reason Neil goes back
        for van zant is to get info about waingro. Van zants last line “how the hell
        would i know?” Is so exasperated. He’s hit rock bottom.

        Charlene thinks that Marciano is legit and an isolated backup plan from
        Chris. But the reveal in Venice that he’s been leveraged she is super
        disappointed. God damnit how did you get leveraged also?. Like Neil,
        Charlene is not going back

        Blake: looking at every minute of this movie doesn’t make me bored. This
        movie stands up to the scrutiny. How many would? Not many. It has made me a
        worse movie watcher overall because most movies are so bad and so careless
        with their time.

        Blake: this movie is a genre ruiner. Like try to make a gangster movie in
        the 70s after godfather. People didn’t do it because it solved the genre.
        Not until years later when there were new stories or angles to be told did
        attempts happen again like goodfellas and sopranos.

```

[One-liner analysis on csv files using SQLite in memory mode](https://til.simonwillison.net/sqlite/one-line-csv-operations)

Get all mentions of "one heat", case insensitive, in my ifttt do button notes data.
