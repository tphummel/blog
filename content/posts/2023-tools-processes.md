# Tools I pay for

The highest form of flattery, something so valuable/useful that I would pay out monthly or yearly for the privilege. 

- Notion
- Hey.com Email
- 1Password 
- Dropbox ($119/year via iOS App Store)
- Cloudflare Warp+ ($4.99/mo)
- Cloudflare Workers ($5.00/mo)
- Feedly 

# Nomie

[Brandon Corbin][4] has worked tirelessly for years building [beautiful personal journaling software][5] and asking nearly nothing in return. I was happily a (small) supporter of his work monthly via Github Sponsors. Brandon has (very reasonably) [decided to move on][6] to new projects. Nomie has always been open source and Brandon has gone further by helping users self-host Nomie going forward. Thank you Brandon for everything you've built. So many people love and use your software daily.

I'm now using versions I've hosted on [Cloudlare Pages][7]
- [Nomie 5][8]. Current version for daily use.  
- [Nomie 6][9]. Evaluating.

# Other Critical Tools / Data / Sources of truth

- Google Calendar. I've migrated to [hey][0] for email, but I still host my personal calendar on Google. I'm interested in dedicated tools like [cal.com][1] but haven't yet looked into how to migrate to them. 
- Google Sheets. 
- Github.com. 
- [Cloudflare Pages][7]. State of the art static website hosting. 
- Apple Health. 
- iOS Shortcuts. [Daily Face Picture][12], [Daily Wordle][13]

# Wearables / Body
- Apple Watch. 45mm,  Alumnium, Wifi Only. 
- Oura. Heritage Black, US10. 
- Fitbit. Charge HR 3 (running on fumes, screen no longer works).
- Garmin. Forerunner 220.
- Withings / Nokia Healthmate. Withings Body connected scale. 
- Oral-B iO. Connected Toothbrush. 
- BACtrack. Blood Alcohol 

# Social Media

Social media has many pitfalls and painful effects on the world. I've made my peace with using these tools in an purposeful (somewhat anti-social) way.

- [Swarm][2]. Location checkins. 
- WhatsApp. Family and friends chat. 
- Linkedin. Professional networking. 
- Untappd. Beer reviews and checkins. 
- Vivino. Wine reviews and checkins. 
- Strava. Fitness. 

# Streaming Services / Entertainment

- Apple Podcasts
- Peloton
- [Calm][3]
- Apple TV+

- Audible
- HBO Max
- Disney+
- MLB.tv
- [Shudder][10]

# Workflows

# Tools I'm not using in 2023
