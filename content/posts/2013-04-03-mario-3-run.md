Across two sessions on March 5 and March 9, [Nick][0] and I ran through Super Mario Bros 3. What was done differently this time is we wanted to rate the difficulty of each stage (1 easiest -> 10 hardest).  

Overall the average diffulty on the 90 levels was 3.6 / 10. (I hope there are 90 levels total, i didn't count).

Here are the summaries:

    +---------------------------+------+------+
    |                           | Nick | Tom  |
    +---------------------------+------+------+
    | avg diff w/ zeroes        | 2.37 | 1.23 |
    | total diff points beaten  | 213  | 111  |
    | levels beaten             | 54   | 36   |
    | avg diff per level beaten | 3.94 | 3.08 |
    +---------------------------+------+------+

Here are the full level logs:
