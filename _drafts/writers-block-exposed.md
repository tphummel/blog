One of the major seasonal joys in my life is participating in an exclusive, historic rotisserie baseball league. I was invited inside for the 2008 MLB season. Since then, each new year has progressed like so:

January: 
  - monitor offseason transactions a few times per week. 
  - carry around a scrap of paper containing my potential roster with up to 15 eligible frozen players from the previous season. 

February:
  - Winter Meeting: 
    - meet in Los Feliz for a day of optional offseason waiver claims and sandwiches. 
    - revisit highlights and lowlights from the previous season. 
  - Pitchers and Catchers report to spring training.
