The idea of an arena with rules that govern, two teams, invaders and defenders. Sometimes the rules are totally twisted and change physics, sometimes it is a single element that is tweaked, such as the psyche of the invader. 

Approaches

best/worst defense
best/worst offense

best rule deviations

how should the data be? scoresheets that get run at a particular point in time? likely i'll be using a small set of movies in a single genre to find a best fit for the scoring. 

the data i'm interested in from tvtropes is the tropes listed for a particular movie. many movie : many tropes. a way to scrape all tropes for a single movie and then a listing of tropes with their point values within a particular genre. 

- movies: scores, score timestamp
- tropes: url, visible name, id
