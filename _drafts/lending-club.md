Interest rates are advertised to be sweet. They look sweet. I'm through x payment cycles (months) and it looks sweet. I'm still bracing for my first default. I know it is coming. It is hard to know what diligence can be done from the limited information is presented on the borrowers. To some degree I'm resigned to luck of the draw. 

It would be nice to get exposed to 800+ notes without needing to tie up $20,000. Lack of diversification when you only have $200 in play is dangerous and a single default could eat away all of my gains.
