title: Benjamin Franklin's Plan For Future Conduct
tags: [self help,us history]

My dad bought me [Benjamin Franklin: An American Life][0] by Walter Isaacson last Christmas. Just now am I finally diving into it and Benjamin Franklin is quickly becoming one of my favorite historical figures. Ben was known for his entrepreneurial spirit, creativity, intelligence and pragmatism. During the latter half of 1726 during a boat trip from London to Philadelphia he set down to develop a credo by which he could "live in all respects like a rational creature".

- It is necessary for me to be extremely frugal for some time, till I have paid what I owe.
- To endeavor to speak truth in every instance; to give nobody expectations that are not likely to be answered, but aim at sincerity in every word and action - the most amiable excellence in a rational being.
- To apply myself industriously to whatever business I take in hand, and not divert my mind from my business by any foolish project of suddenly growing rich; for industry and patience are the surest means of plenty.
- I resolve to speak ill of no man whatever.

Lofty? Perhaps. Impractical at times? Maybe. But still pretty on point in my opinion and as relevant today as the day he wrote it.
