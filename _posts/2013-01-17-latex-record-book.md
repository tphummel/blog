title: Creating a LaTeX Record Book
tags: [latex, tetris]
---
  
I wanted to create a record book with [LaTeX][4] for a [game][2] my friends and I used to play a lot in college. Basically the goal was to extract exceptional games from mysql that matched a particular criteria and publish in pleasant looking tables. I also envision the tables being flanked by some strategy articles and historical anecdotes someday. Check out the [slides][0], [code][1], and [final product][3].
